## Why Should I Use PingU?
1. **You want to signal your partner that you needed immediate attention in one button!**

2. **You want to be as annoying as possible if he doesn't respond to you.**

PingU allows you to *partner* your beloved and signal them that you needed attention with a blinking widget alert. 

## Features
- A blinking widget for quick signalling.
- Users can ping and answer pings from their partner through the widget. 
- A ping counter for how many times the user has pinged their partner.
